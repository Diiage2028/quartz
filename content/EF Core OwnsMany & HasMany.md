## 🔖 EF Core: When to Use `OwnsMany` vs `HasMany`

In **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**, `OwnsMany` and `HasMany` define **one-to-many relationships**, but they serve different purposes based on entity identity and ownership semantics.

---

### ✅ `HasMany`

- **Used for**: Standard one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.
    
- **Entities have independent identities** and exist as separate tables.
    
- Common for entities like:
    
    - **Customer → Orders**
        
- Supports:
    
    - Independent querying
        
    - CRUD operations without affecting the owner
        
    - Referential integrity
        

**Example**:  
A `Customer` can have many `Orders`. Orders are standalone entities with their own keys.

---

### ✅ `OwnsMany`

- **Used for**: Owned collections that are conceptually part of the parent.
    
- **Entities don’t have independent identity** and usually **share a lifecycle** with the owner.
    
- Common for:
    
    - **Order → LineItems**
        
- Stored in a way that ties them closely to their parent.
    

**Important Notes**:

- Requires a **primary key**, even for owned types.
    
- EF Core provides two strategies:
    
    1. **Surrogate Key**: A new independent key (e.g., GUID or auto-increment int).
        
        - Allows moving child between parents (less common in aggregates).
            
    2. **Composite Key** _(Default)_: Combines owner’s FK + another property.
        
        - Enforces **strong ownership**, child cannot move between parents.
            
        - Reflects **DDD Aggregate** patterns.

### 🧠 Choosing Between `OwnsMany` and `HasMany`

| Scenario                          | Use `HasMany` | Use `OwnsMany`                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Child has own identity            | ✅             | ❌                              |
| Child is part of parent           | ❌             | ✅                              |
| Needs independent querying        | ✅             | ❌                              |
| Reflects aggregate root pattern   | ❌             | ✅                              |
| Child should move between parents | ✅ (with FK)   | ❌ (composite PK prevents this) |
